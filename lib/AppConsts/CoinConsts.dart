      "Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency created in 2009 by an unknown person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on a peer-to-peer network, allowing transactions to occur directly between users without intermediaries like banks. Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability. Its maximum supply is capped at 21 million coins, making it deflationary. New bitcoins are created through mining, where powerful computers solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and secure the network. Bitcoin's decentralization prevents any single entity from controlling it. Its price is highly volatile, making it both risky and potentially lucrative as an investment. Bitcoins are stored in digital wallets, which can be software-based or hardware-based. Bitcoin adoption has increased over the years, with businesses accepting it as payment and institutional investors investing in it as an asset class. Regulatory environments vary globally, with some countries embracing Bitcoin and others imposing restrictions or bans on its use.";
